# HR Analysis

# 1. Introduction

In the intricate landscape of Human Resources Management, our study is particularly focused on the pivotal subject of "Employee Turnover Analysis." This targeted emphasis is carefully chosen to dissect and understand the multifaceted nature of employee attrition and retention through a detailed segmentation approach. Anchoring our analysis is the robust dataset provided by Topica Ed Tech, a rich repository of information that we plan to meticulously analyze to discern patterns and trends in employee turnover.

## Topic Overview

Our objective is to leverage this data to identify key factors that contribute to turnover rates, understand how they vary across different employee clusters, and propose strategic interventions to foster a stable and engaged workforce. Through this initiative, we aspire to provide actionable insights that can significantly reduce turnover and cultivate a more committed and productive organizational environment.

## Data Exploration

Our exploration begins with the "HR_DATA" table, examining metrics like department, division, and employment duration to understand turnover patterns within Topica. The "Turnover Rate per Company Location" allows us to assess the turnover geographically, identifying if certain regions are more affected. Additionally, the "Dim_NG" and "Top 5 Positions in January" focus on specific job roles and their turnover rates, potentially uncovering roles that may require more attention due to higher attrition rates. This targeted analysis of turnover by location and position sets the stage for deeper investigation into the root causes of employee departure.
